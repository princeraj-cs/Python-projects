# Python Projects

This repository is a collection of my Python projects. I'll upload each project in its own folder with a short README explaining what the project does and how to run it.

## Repository structure

Each project should follow this structure:

- project-name/
  - README.md        # short description, how to run, dependencies
  - requirements.txt # (optional) Python dependencies
  - src/ or project files
  - tests/ (optional)

Top-level files:

- README.md (this file)
- LICENSE (optional)

## How to run a project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/princeraj-cs/Python-projects.git

2. Change into the project directory:

   cd Python-projects/project-name

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows (PowerShell)

4. Install dependencies if a requirements.txt file is provided:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the project according to the project's README (usually a main script in the project folder):

   python main.py

## How to add your own project

- Create a new folder with a clear, descriptive name.
- Add a README.md inside the project folder describing the project, how to run it, and any prerequisites.
- If the project has dependencies, include a requirements.txt file.
- Add tests if available and provide instructions to run them.
- Submit a pull request or push directly if you have permission.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you want to add a project or improve an existing one:

1. Fork this repository (or create a branch).
2. Add your project folder with the required files.
3. Open a pull request describing your changes.

## License

Most projects may include their own license. If you want a default license for this repository, consider adding an `LICENSE` file (for example, MIT).
